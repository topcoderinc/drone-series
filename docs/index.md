# Phase 2B

## Introduction to Phase 2B
The next phase Drone Series, which we are calling 2b,  will begin at the end of February 2017 and run through May.   This Phase has three primary objectives.

 1. Drone request Scheduling
 2. Fleet Management
 3. Data (flight log) retrieval, parsing and storage

 Some of these objectives will build on the previous phase front-end and back-end and others will be new

### Drone Request Scheduling
A drone request is a set of instructions that a consumer provides to a drone service provider and drone pilot.  The request may include and area on a map and explicit instruction of what the pilot should photograph.  An example [(request example 1)](TODO) might include a request for a drone to take ariel images of a wedding.  This example has a tightly constrained start and end time.  This request becomes a mission(TODO definition) which has 1 flight.
